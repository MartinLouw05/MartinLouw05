### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an entry-level Software Developer looking for a position where I can learn on the job. I obtained my Bachelor of Commerce: Informatics qualification in November 2020 and recently graduated from CodeSpace Academy, where I completed a Software Development course, and I am proficient in PHP, MySQL, and full-stack JavaScript. My studies have prepared me to be able to learn rapidly, and I am committed to learning new technologies and languages.
